---Questions
--3.1 Select all warehouses.
SELECT * FROM Warehouses;

--3.2 Select all boxes with a value larger than $150.
SELECT * FROM Boxes
WHERE Value > 150;

--3.3 Select all distinct contents in all the boxes.
SELECT DISTINCT Contents FROM Boxes;

--3.4 Select the average value of all the boxes.
SELECT AVG(Value) FROM Boxes;

--3.5 Select the warehouse code and the average value of the boxes in each warehouse.
SELECT Warehouses.Code, AVG(Value)
FROM Warehouses
JOIN Boxes on Boxes.Warehouse = Warehouses.Code
GROUP BY Warehouses.Code;

--3.6 Same as previous exercise, but select only those warehouses where the average value of the boxes is greater than 150.
SELECT Warehouses.Code, AVG(Value)
FROM Warehouses
JOIN Boxes on Boxes.Warehouse = Warehouses.Code
GROUP BY Warehouses.Code
HAVING (SELECT AVG(Value) FROM Boxes GROUP BY Boxes.Warehouse) > 150;

--3.7 Select the code of each box, along with the name of the city the box is located in.
SELECT Boxes.Code as 'Box Code', Location
FROM Boxes
JOIN Warehouses
ON Boxes.Warehouse = Warehouses.Code;

--3.8 Select the warehouse codes, along with the number of boxes in each warehouse. 
SELECT Warehouses.Code AS 'Warehouse Code', COUNT(Boxes.Code) AS 'Total Boxes'
FROM Warehouses
JOIN Boxes
ON Boxes.Warehouse = Warehouses.Code
GROUP BY Warehouses.code

--3.9 Select the codes of all warehouses that are saturated (a warehouse is saturated if the number of boxes in it is larger than the warehouse's capacity).
SELECT Warehouses.Code AS 'Warehouse Code', COUNT(Boxes.Code) AS 'Total Boxes', Capacity
FROM Warehouses
JOIN Boxes
ON Boxes.Warehouse = Warehouses.Code
GROUP BY Warehouses.code
HAVING COUNT(Boxes.Code) > Capacity;

--3.10 Select the codes of all the boxes located in Chicago.
SELECT Boxes.Code
FROM Boxes
JOIN Warehouses
ON Boxes.Warehouse = Warehouses.Code
WHERE Warehouses.Location = 'Chicago';

--3.11 Create a new warehouse in New York with a capacity for 3 boxes.
INSERT INTO Warehouses VALUES (6, 'New York', 3);

--3.12 Create a new box, with code "H5RT", containing "Papers" with a value of $200, and located in warehouse 2.
INSERT INTO Boxes VALUES ('H5RT','Papers', 200, 2);

--3.13 Reduce the value of all boxes by 15%.
UPDATE 	Boxes
SET Value = Value * .9;

--3.14 Remove all boxes with a value lower than $100.
DELETE FROM Boxes
WHERE Value < 100;

-- 3.15 Remove all boxes from saturated warehouses.
DELETE FROM Boxes
WHERE Warehouse IN (SELECT Warehouses.Code
FROM Warehouses
JOIN Boxes
ON Boxes.Warehouse = Warehouses.Code
GROUP BY Warehouses.code
HAVING COUNT(Boxes.Code) >= Capacity)

-- 3.16 Add Index for column "Warehouse" in table "boxes" !!!NOTE!!!: index should NOT be used on small tables in practice
CREATE INDEX idx_warehouse 
ON Boxes (Warehouse);

-- 3.17 Print all the existing indexes !!!NOTE!!!: index should NOT be used on small tables in practice
SELECT name, tbl_name 
FROM sqlite_master 
WHERE type = 'index';

-- 3.18 Remove (drop) the index you added just !!!NOTE!!!: index should NOT be used on small tables in practice
DROP INDEX idx_warehouse;
